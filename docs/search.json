It comprises the RMSD, MCQ and TM-Score\n\n\nMetrics\nTo compute the quality of a predicted structure compared to the native structure, we can consider different metrics.\nGiven a predicted structure X and a native structure Y with N atoms, we have\n\nRMSD: root mean square deviation, computed as:\n\n\\[\nRMSD(X,Y) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i - Y_i}{N}}\n\\]\nNote that X and Y should be aligned.\n\nMCQ (Zok, Popenda, and Szachniuk (2013)): Mean of Circular Quantities, which gives a comparison in torsion angle space. The mathematical is complex, and so no need to have a more detail look to it.\nTM-Score (Gong, Zhang, and Zhang (2019),Zhang and Skolnick (2004)): Template-Modeling, aims to give a metrics that is independant of the length of the structures. It is defined as:\n\n\\[\nTM_{score_{RNA}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^{L_{ali}} \\frac{1}{1+(\\frac{d_i}{d_0})^2}\n\\]\nwith \\[\nd_0 = 0.6\\sqrt{L-0.5} - 2.5\n\\]\nbeing the scaling factor to ensure the score of random RNA pairs is independent of RNA length.\nWe don’t ask you to implement these metrics, the results are given in the project. You should just keep in mind the general ideas of the metrics: RMSD and TM-Score are distance-based, and MCQ is based on torsional angles (and don’t consider spatial distances)."
