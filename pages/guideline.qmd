- Presentation of 10 min (**Tuesday, December, 3rd**)
:::

:::{.callout-important}
### More details
- You should send a mail before **Sunday, December, 1st** at `clement.bernard@univ-evry.fr` with object `"M2-GENIOMHE Project - GROUP X"` (with X your group number)

## Group

Please create your group and complete the following [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6drO62cX62KW-_4MRwvXW-8GXejj0SMUUjQoDxZ-3g/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Source code

The source code should have the following requirements:

- Have a `README` to explain how is structured the codes, the installation requirements.
- Have a method that, given a native structure and a predicted structure, will output one of your CG-RMSD.


Your code should include a file with this interface: 
```{python}

class CustomCGRMSD:
  def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # TO BE COMPLETE
    pass


  def predict(self, native_path: str, predicted_path: str) -> float:
    """
    Function that should predict CG-RMSD.
    Args:
      - in_path: path to a `.pdb` native file
      - predicted_path: path to a `.pdb` predicted file
    :return your custom CG-RMSD metric
    """
    # To complete
    return None
```
