## Help - Tutorial Pytorch

If you're using Pytorch, you can have a look at this [Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LmxkKsUhDXUnl3XW2-JEsZocPx2arepL?usp=sharing) that shows an example of training for sequential data. 

If you're using something else than Pytorch, you can still look at the input and output shapes to help you in the development process. 

## Help - coding good practices

To have a look at how to organize the code (in terms of folders, importations, etc), you can see this [repository](https://github.com/clementbernardd/m2_project_good_practices/tree/main).
