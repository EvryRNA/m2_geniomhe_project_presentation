### Goal
- Given groups of 2/3, the aim of the project is to predict compute coarse-grained RMSD and to compute its correlation with three metrics: `RMSD`, `MCQ` and `TM-Score`.
- The question to be answered: **Which coarse-grained representation has the highest correlation to current metrics?**
- You should discuss the correlation results with insights on specificities on the compared metrics. 
- Link to complete with your names for the group: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l6drO62cX62KW-_4MRwvXW-8GXejj0SMUUjQoDxZ-3g/edit?usp=sharing). 
- Github link to dataset to download: [link](https://github.com/clementbernardd/custom_rmsd_m2_geniomhe). 
- The notation would be equal part from your code and the presentation. 
- Notation for the code would include:
    - Quality of code (documentation, structure)
    - Detailed README.md with explanation about your repository
    - Is the function to compute the custom RMSD is working?
    - Git workflow: did you use git during the development and not only at the end?
- Notation for the 10 min presentation would include:
    - General quality of the presenation
    - Comprehension of the project and its limits
    - Discussion about correlation scores

## Coarse-grained RMSD vs classic metrics

The goal of the project is to compute a custom coarse-grained RMSD and to compare its correlation with three main metrics: `RMSD`, `MCQ` and `TM-Score`.

## Metrics

Metrics compute the quality of a predicted structure **given a native one**.

Your goal is to compute custom coarse-grained RMSD (with different atom per nucleotide), and then to compare the correlation to three metrics.

## Custom coarse-grained RMSD

### RMSD computation
To compute the RMSD, you have to compute the deviation per atom. But first, you need to superimpose the two structures.

You would need to choose a coarse-grained representation: which atom to consider for the RMSD computation. In real RMSD computation, all the atoms are considered.

::: {.column width="50%"}
You would have to choose which atoms to consider for the coarse-grained RMSD computation.
You can choose among: 

- P
- O5'
- C5'
- C4'
- C3'
- C2'
- C1'
- O1'
- O3'

Or any combination between them. 
You can also compute full-atom RMSD to have a comparison.

## Dataset

The datasets are available in this [link](https://github.com/clementbernardd/custom_rmsd_m2_geniomhe). 

- **NATIVE**: native `.pdb` structures from a community challenge RNA-Puzzles (@rna_puzzles) (22 non-redundant RNAs)
- **PREDS**: predicted `.pdb` structures from different models.
- **SCORES**: metrics computed between the native structures and the predicted ones. It comprises the `RMSD`, `MCQ` and `TM-Score`



### Metrics 

To compute the quality of a predicted structure compared to the native structure, we can consider different metrics.

Given a predicted structure X and a native structure Y with N `atoms`, we have

- `RMSD`: root mean square deviation, computed as:

$$
RMSD(X,Y) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i - Y_i}{N}}
$$

Note that X and Y should be aligned. 

- `MCQ` (@mcq): Mean of Circular Quantities, which gives a comparison in torsion angle space. The mathematical is complex, and so no need to have a more detail look to it.

- `TM-Score` (@tm-score,@tm-score-rna): Template-Modeling, aims to give a metrics that is independant of the length of the structures. It is defined as:

$$
TM_{score_{RNA}} = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^{L_{ali}} \frac{1}{1+(\frac{d_i}{d_0})^2}
$$

with 
$$
d_0 = 0.6\sqrt{L-0.5} - 2.5
$$
 
being the scaling factor to ensure the score of random RNA pairs is independent of RNA length. 


We don't ask you to implement these metrics, the results are given in the project. You should just keep in mind the general ideas of the metrics: `RMSD` and `TM-Score` are distance-based, and `MCQ` is based on torsional angles (and don't consider spatial distances).

## Correlation

To compute the correlation between two sets of points (and so between your custom CG-RMSD and the metrics), you can use:

- Spearman correlation 
- Pearson correlation coefficient

Note that you would need to discuss the differences between these correlation factors.
