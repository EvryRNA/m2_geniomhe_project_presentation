## RNA torsional angles

Nucleotides can be described by **7 torsional angles** and **2 pseudo-torsional angles**

## RNA torsional angles

:::{.callout-note}
- Predicting torsional and/or pseudo-torsional angles could help to resolve 3D conformational folding
- For each nucleotide, we could angles instead of positions

## SPOT-RNA-1D

- Predict torsional and pseudo-torsional angles from the sequence


:::{.callout-warning}
### Limits
- Results fall short of expectations
- Neural network architecture could be improved for sequential data
- Is the regression the best method ?

### Goal
- Given groups of 2/3, the aim of the project is to predict *one* torsional/pseudo-torsional angle per nucleotide
- The question to be answered: **Is classification better than regression for this task ?**
- Instead of doing regression, the aim would be to try a deep learning architecture for:
    - Binary classification
    - Multiclass
- The deep learning architecture doesn't have to be complex (an RNN is sufficient)
- You should compare the results of the classification to SPOT-RNA-1D results

### Dataset

The datasets are available in the skeleton code available at this [link](https://github.com/EvryRNA/m2_geniomhe_rna_project/tree/main). 

- **Training set**: dataset from rsRNASP (@rsrnasp) (192 non-redundant RNAs)
- **Test set**: RNA Puzzles (@rna_puzzles) (29 RNAs)

You should only consider chain A when this is a multi-stranded RNA.

### Metrics 
The metric to compare the performances is the (Mean Absolute Error). 

- **Mean absolute Error (MAE)** 

. . . 

$$
MAE = \min(d_i, 360-d_i)
$$

with:
$$
d_i = | angle_i^{pred} - angle_i^{true} | 
$$

## Implementation 

A brief description of the workflow of the project is described in the following figure.
